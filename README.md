I developed an app that suggests meals to users based on the time of day they choose. This app was designed to address the user's needs in a simple and straightforward manner. For the design, I relied on my own ideas, striving for simplicity and directness to assist the user. I decided to include images of meals that correspond to different times of the day, with buttons below linked to specific meal times. a user clicks on their desired button, they are taken to another page that lists the meals they can consume at that chosen time. My project is available on GitHub for review by lecturers and others interested in seeing how the project was developed.
